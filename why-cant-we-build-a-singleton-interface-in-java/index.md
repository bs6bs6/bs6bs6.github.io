# Why can't we build a Singleton Interface in Java？


### Why can't we build a Singleton Interface in Java？

This is a typical Singleton implementation in Java program:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return INSTANCE;
    }
}

```

That's a graceful Singleton implementation in C#:

```C#
public abstract class Singleton <T>{
    private static T singleton;

}
```

In this C# code, we can simply extend this abstract Singleton class to make the Class a Singleton class. But we can never do this in Java. That's because **We cannot define a static Generics type(Class<T>) in Java**. 

Why does this thing happen? Why it works in C#?

To figure out this question, we should focus on differences in implementation of  Generics between Java and C#.

#### Generics in Java: Type Erasure 

In Java, generics were introduced to provide type safety at compile-time. However, at runtime, generic information is erased, i.e., it disappears. This means that at the bytecode level, generics don't exist, and everything degenerates to its upper bound, typically the Object type. Why choose type erasure? Mainly to maintain backward compatibility with older versions of Java code. A consequence of this approach is that at runtime, you cannot inquire whether an object is of a specific generic type (for example, you cannot determine whether a collection is a List<String> or a List<Integer>).



#### Generics in C#: Reification 

In C#, generics retain their type information at runtime. That is, when you create a List<int>, the CLR (Common Language Runtime) generates a specific type for it, different from the type of List<string>. This allows C# to perform type queries, conversions, and other operations dependent on generic type information at runtime. Of course, this approach has a downside: since each different generic instance might require separate code, it can potentially increase the size and memory usage of the application.



Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Java chose type erasure for backward compatibility, while C#, without such historical baggage, opted to retain runtime generic information. This difference results in varying behavior between Java and C# when using generics.
